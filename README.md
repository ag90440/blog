### Backend
- **Technologies:** Node.js, Express, MongoDB, Mongoose, TypeScript
- **Directory Structure:**
  - `src/`
    - `controllers/` - Contains the controllers that handle the requests and responses.
    - `models/` - Contains the Mongoose models defining the data structure.
    - `routes/` - Defines the API routes and their handlers.
    - `services/` - Contains services that handle business logic, like authentication and data manipulation.
    - `middlewares/` - Contains middleware for handling authentication, error handling, etc.
    - `config/` - Configuration files, including database setup.

### Frontend
- **Technologies:** Angular, Angular Material, RxJS
- **Directory Structure:**
  - `src/`
    - `app/`
      - `components/` - Contains all Angular components (e.g., question-list, question-edit, login).
      - `services/` - Angular services to interact with the backend.
      - `models/` - TypeScript interfaces and models for the applicationâ€™s data.
      - `modules/` - Angular modules for organizing components and services.
    - `assets/` - Contains static assets like images, icons, etc.
    - `styles/` - Global styles for the application.
